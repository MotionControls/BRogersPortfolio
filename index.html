		<h2>What is this site?</h2>
		<p id="article_body">
			This site is meant to house my portfolio.<br>
			Right now it is a bit basic, but I plan to refine it over time.
		</p>
		<h2 id="article_head">What leads to where?</h2>
		<p id="article_body">
			For now this page will house this text-block here and what will eventually be the content in <a href="index.html">About Me</a>.<br>
			Once I get everything a bit more setup, this page will host the latest changes to the site.<br>
			<a href="index.html">About Me</a> will contain some information about myself, including my name, interests, and resumes.<br>
			<a href="project_index.html">Projects</a> will include a variety of personal projects that I've attempted during my time at school.<br>
			This will include projects that I'm currently working on and old projects that either don't meet my current standards or
			I've lost interest in but still find value talking about.
		</p>
		<h1 id="article_head">ABOUT ME</h1>
		<p id="article_body">
			A nice looking headshot will go here eventually.<br><br>
			I'm a junior Computer Science student currently situated at Tennessee Tech University.<br>
			I have a concentration in Data Science, but I also take interest in working with old, outdated technology such as the Super Nintendo.<br>
			Hop on over to <a href="project_index.html">Projects</a> to see some of the stuff I'm currently working on.<br>
