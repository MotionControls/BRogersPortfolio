		<h2>What is this site?</h2>
		<p id="article_body">
			This site is meant to house my portfolio.<br>
			Right now it is a bit basic, but I plan to refine it over time.
		</p>
		<h2 id="article_head">What leads to where?</h2>
		<p id="article_body">
			For now this page will house this text-block here and what will eventually be the content in <a href="index.html">About Me</a>.<br>
			Once I get everything a bit more setup, this page will host the latest changes to the site.<br>
			<a href="index.html">About Me</a> will contain some information about myself, including my name, interests, and resumes.<br>
			<a href="project_index.html">Projects</a> will include a variety of personal projects that I've attempted during my time at school.
			This will include projects that I'm currently working on and old projects that either don't meet my current standards or
			I've lost interest in but still find value talking about.
