				DISCLAIMER<br><br>
				This definitely shouldn't be seen as a tutorial. I like to think I'm good at doing research but there is a less than insignificant
				chance that I've gotten some things wrong. If you're interested in developing for the Playstation 1, I'd recommend exploring some of the
				links at the bottom of the article.
			</p>
			
			<h2 id="section_header">Introduction</h2>
			Ever since I got into making homebrew for old consoles, I had always wanted to make something for the Playstation 1.
			But I had always waited because I had assumed that, being among the first consoles to really push 3D, it would be really hard to develop for.
			After the Game Dev Club's week-long game jam in fall 2024, I decided to at least check it out.
			The worst that could happen was a wasted hour. <br><br>
			
			I was pleasantly surprised to find that not only was it quite easy to develop for the Playstation 1,
			it is arguably one of the easiest consoles to develop homebrew for. This is largely thanks to the many resources found from
			the <a href="https://www.psx.dev/getting-started">PSX.Dev</a> community and <a href="https://psx.arthus.net/starting.html">PSX Arthus</a>.<br><br>
			
			To learn the basics of PSX dev, I decided to create a simple Breakout clone. Unlike most of my other projects, I decided I didn't need
			to create a whole design document, as I wasn't sure how far I'd really be willing to take this project before moving on to something else.<br><br>
			
			<h2 id="section_header">First Steps</h2>
			The first and, arguably, most important part of this whole shebang was deciding which tools I would use.
			According to Arthus, the two big libraries are <a href="https://github.com/ABelliqueux/nolibgs_hello_worlds">Nugget+PsyQ</a> and
			<a href="https://github.com/Lameguy64/PSn00bSDK">PSn00bSDK</a>.
			From a beginner's perspective, both seem to accomplish the same thing. The biggest notable difference I could find is in the amount of support I could get.
			Seeing as how PSn00bSDK is the most recent of the two, I decided to go with PsyQ.<br><br>
			
			Next was the emulator. I had considered getting something setup to allow me to play on a real console, but at this point I both
			didn't have a PS1 and didn't want to go through the trouble of turning it into a devkit. <a href="https://duckstation.org/">DuckStation</a>
			was at the top of my list, but I ended up going with <a href="https://github.com/grumpycoders/pcsx-redux">PCSX-Redux</a>. Though I don't think
			it's ideal for general play, it has <b>loads</b> of features for developers.<br><br>
			
			I'll eventually need more tools to handle some concepts I don't quite understand yet, but for now this was my base toolkit.<br><br>
			
			<h2 id="section_header">The Examples</h2>
			After getting something of an environment setup, it was time to explore the examples provided by <a href="https://github.com/ABelliqueux/nolibgs_hello_worlds">nolibgs</a>.<br><br>
			
			hello_world was my first choice, and I was already having tons of information thrown at me.<br>
			Lets take hello_world.c a few steps at a time.<br>
			
			<pre id="codeblock">

#define VMODE 0                 // Video Mode : 0 : NTSC, 1: PAL
#define SCREENXRES 320          // Screen width
#define SCREENYRES 240          // Screen height
#define CENTERX SCREENXRES/2    // Center of screen on x 
#define CENTERY SCREENYRES/2    // Center of screen on y
#define MARGINX 0               // margins for text display
#define MARGINY 32
#define FONTSIZE 8 * 7          // Text Field Height
			</pre>
			
			<p id="rant">
				Most of these are pretty self-explanatory, but I feel I should go over VMODE.<br>
				Old consoles were split into two regions: NTSC (US/JP) and PAL (EU). While NTSC games ran at 60hz with a resolution of 320x240,
				PAL games ran at 50hz with a resolution of 320x256. Due to this discrepancy, it is important that games account for the change in
				resolution and speed. For example: Beatmania is optimised to run at full speed on PAL systems, while Ape Escape runs 17% slower on PAL systems.
			</p>
			
			That isn't too bad. Next are the video buffers.
			
			<pre id="codeblock">

DISPENV disp[2];	// Double buffered DISPENV and DRAWENV
DRAWENV draw[2];
short db = 0;		// index of which buffer is used, values 0, 1
			</pre>
			
			To properly explain this I'll have to explain how the PS1 handles VRAM.<br>
			VRAM is arranged into multiple 64x256 sections called texture pages. With 16 pages being stacked on top of another 16 pages,
			we get a total texture space of 1024x512 arranged like this:
			
			<pre style="text-align:center;">
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|TP01|TP02|TP03|TP04|TP05|TP06|TP07|TP08|TP09|TP10|TP11|TP12|TP13|TP14|TP15|TP16|
|====|====|====|====|====|====|====|====|====|====|====|====|====|====|====|====|
|TP17|TP18|TP19|TP20|TP21|TP22|TP23|TP24|TP25|TP26|TP27|TP28|TP29|TP30|TP31|TP32|
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
			</pre>
			
			DISPENV holds information about the current display and display settings. It is essentially what is shown to the player.
			DRAWENV holds information about what's currently being drawn and how it is drawn. Unlike DISPENV, this isn't shown to the player and
			instead positioned somewhere in VRAM.<br>
			I'm not entirely sure how to explain double-buffering, but just understand that it helps us hide artifacts when rendering frames.
